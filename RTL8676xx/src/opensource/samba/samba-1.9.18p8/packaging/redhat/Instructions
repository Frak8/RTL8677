Preparation of RedHat RPM packages.

Version Numbers:
================
The numbering scheme adopted consists of:
	samba-1.9.18p2-50.11.i386.rpm
		The Samba release version here is: 1.9.18p2
		The Red Hat Linux version this is for is: 5.0
		The issue number is: 11
		The Architecture for this RPM is: Intel (i386)

Please, please - PLEASE!!! Do NOT issue any duplicate issue numbers
as this will cause confusion. If you really have to make public any
issue of the Red Hat RPMs then please mail jht@samba.anu.edu.au to
ensure that duplicates can be avoided. Also, post a message to:
samba@samba.anu.edu.au clearly copying us all of your action. We DO NOT
want confusion of RPM package issue numbers.

Preparation Process:
====================
1. Copy the official Samba-latest.tar.gz archive to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
2. Un-gnuzip the file to the plain tar archive format
3. Untar the archive to access the samba/examples/redhat files
4. Copy the samba-make.patch file to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
5. Copy samba.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
6. Delete the extracted archive (see item 3)
7. Go to the /usr/src/redhat/SPECS directory
8. Execute: rpm -ba -v samba.spec

Notice: All the above can be achieved simply by going to the relevant
	samba version directory (eg: ~samba-x.yy.zz/packaging/redhat/RH50)
	then executing "makerpms.sh"

9. Copy the SRPM file from the /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS directory
	and copy the RPMS file from the /usr/src/redhat/RPMS directory
	to the distribution point from which the finished packages will
	be uploaded to the samba ftp archive.

Finito!!
