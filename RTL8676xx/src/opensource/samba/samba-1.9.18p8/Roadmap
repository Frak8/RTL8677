The Samba-Team are committed to an agressive program to deliver quality
controlled software to a well defined roadmap.

The current Samba release 1.9.18 is called the "Oplock Release"
The following development objectives are in place:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please Note: Development of the 1.9.19 and 1.9.20 releases is presently
	     well ahead of schedule. This means that the release program
	     may very well change radically from what is outlined below.

	     If present developments continue then 1.9.19 will feature
	     improved authentication and security capabilities as well as
	     the long promised GUI (Web) based management tools.

	     This being the case, then version 2.0 may become the long
	     awaited Windows NT Domain Controller Release and version 2.1
	     will become the Directory Services update.

	     Should 1.9.19 roll out ahead of schedule then there will
	     likely be a delay of up to 6 months before the NT Domain
	     Controller release will be ready for prime-time business use.

Version	/ Codename	Notes
------------------	----------------------------------------------------
1.9.19			An authentication update release to offer improved
"Auth Code Release"	security and password synchronisation capabilities.
                        Also, support for Windows NT specific SMB calls.

1.9.20			Introduction of new managment tools
"GUI Config Release"	Improved multi-language support.

2.0			The next generation Directory Services update
"DSA Release"

While no release date or content promises are made we are hoping to release
the remainder of the 1.9 series relases within short time frame.

Should a budding contributor spring into gear and deliver any of the above
ahead of the above release sequence then we reserve the option to make an
out of sequence release (but always keeping to a logical sequence code number).
