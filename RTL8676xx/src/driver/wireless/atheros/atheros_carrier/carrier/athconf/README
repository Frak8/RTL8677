Summary
-------
The athconf utility allows a user to configure the transmit power per rate settings in the MAC/BB registers of the Owl chip.

Requirements:
---------------
Linux Madwifi driver version 7.0.0.20 and above.

Build/installation instructions
-------------------------------

1. Copy the athconf directory to the following directory location: <src tree head>/wlan/madwifi/madwifi/
2. Add an entry athconf to the Makefile in the directory
3. Build the madwifi driver (follow instructions).
4. The module athconf.ko will be available in the athconf directory.
5. Tftp the module athconf.ko to the AP.

Operation:
----------
1. Start the AP

2. Load the module and (you must be in the directory where the module has been saved): 
#insmod athconf.ko
#cd /proc/sys/athconf/<device name>/powerperate            (the device name is wifi0, wifi1 etc.)

3. Change power per rate (the MAC registers store power in 0.5dBm units)
  
#echo <power in 0.5 dbm units> > <rate>
E.g.   #echo 10 > rateHt40_7                                 (this instruction sets power for HT 40 MCS 7 to 5dBm)

4. Write the new rate to the MAC/BB regs:
#echo 1 > write

5. Read the current MAC/BB settings
#echo 1 > print

Note: The initial values for the power per rate are read from the eeprom. Once the module is loaded, 
the driver will not read the power per rate values from the eeprom anymore. Even after a reset, 
the values configured through athconf will be used. To reinitialize to the eeprom setting, unload the 
athconf module and restart the AP.

Limitations
-----------

1. If the AP is brought down, athconf must be removed via rmmod. Then the AP must be brought up and 
athconf must be reload via insmod.
2. The max power per rate is intentionally limited to 25dB.
