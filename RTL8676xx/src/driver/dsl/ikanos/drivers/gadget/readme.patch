1. Have a old copy of gadget directory and rename it to gadget_old 
2. Rename the working copy of gadget directory to gadget_new. Remove *.o
   *.ko,all hidden files,*.cmd and any other unnecessary files	
3. Issue the command 
   diff -Naru gadget_old gadget_new > {data_of_creation}_vox160gadget.patch 
   e.g. diff -Naru gadget_old gadget_new > 20060424_vox160gadget.patch 
4. Combine all the patch to create a single unified patch using combinediff
   command.Note that the diff files must be listed in the order that they are 
   to be applied. So list the patch file with old data as first argument and 
   so  on. Also Note that the two patches must be in strict incremental or-
   der
   e.g combinediff 20060424_vox160gadget.patch 20060426_vox160gadget.patch >
       vox160gadget_unified.patch
5. Only unified patch should be applied to the gadget directory of linux kernel
   source tree.  
   e.g cd gadget
   patch -p1 < 20060426_vox160gadget_unified.patch
