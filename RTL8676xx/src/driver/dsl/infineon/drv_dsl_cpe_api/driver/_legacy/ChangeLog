bugfix(es):
- Correction for SNRMds reboot criteria takes 6-bit signed value in account and
  also handles values smaller than zero
- Included special handling regarding HDLC processing:
  * While in L2 power mode NO HDLC processing will be done because of to low
    bandwidth
  * If L2 power mode is terminated again it will be checked whether the HDLC is
    in still in BUSY state for more than 10 seconds. In this case the HDLC
    firmware processing will be reset
- Minor corrections for datarate calculation in ADSL2/2+
- The upstream output power does not change in showtime. Hence there is no
  necessity to read it through OHC
